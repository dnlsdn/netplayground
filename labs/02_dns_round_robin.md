# Lab 02 â€” DNS Caching & Round-Robin

**Goal**
- Observe alternating A records for the same hostname and how TTL impacts caching.

**Background**
- DNS can balance load using multiple A records; resolvers may cache answers.

**Prerequisites**
- Will be available after Step 5+ (dns service configured) and Step 4 (web services).

**Steps**
- TBA in later steps (repeat `dig` queries and HTTP requests, compare answers).

**Observe**
- Alternating IPs in answers and corresponding server responses.

**Cleanup**
- None required.
