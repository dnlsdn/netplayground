# Labs — Guided Exercises

Each lab follows a consistent structure:
- **Goal** — what you will accomplish and observe.
- **Background** — key concepts and why they matter.
- **Prerequisites** — what needs to be running/configured.
- **Steps** — exact commands to run.
- **Observe** — what to look for (outputs, counters, packet traces).
- **Cleanup** — how to revert or stop captures.

## Index
- `01_tcp_handshake.md` — TCP three-way handshake (SYN → SYN/ACK → ACK) via packet capture.
- `02_dns_round_robin.md` — DNS caching and round-robin answers.
- `03_nat_port_forwarding.md` — Source NAT (masquerade) and DNAT port forwarding.

> These labs will become runnable in later steps once services are added.
